# fantasticbits

This is the code I wrote for the old fantasticbits contest on codingames. Currently this code is uncomplete as I got
too busy with school to work on it for now... I was in the process of better organzing my code and simulating future turns so I could 
implement some kind of min/max tree or genetic algorthim. Right now the code is very messy and poorly commented but, it can accurately
simulate some of the game's physics engine and I'm near the top of gold league.

The contest is here...
